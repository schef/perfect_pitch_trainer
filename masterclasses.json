I'm aware now that each tone has its own place in space.\n\np.s. don't force yourself.\n\n[b]Keywords[/b]\nWe learn to distinguish these colors between the very fine variations that there are the tones.\nBut they become very clear. We get to know this sound colors.\nWe have to get it out of that habit (listening horizontally) and into the habit of listening inside the tones.\nComposers have used variates keys and chords in different ways for different reasons even unconsciously.\nAbsolute pitch training is a effortless training. What we don't wanna do is practice perfect pitch training with this idea that your gonna get in there and force your ear and wipe it and shape. If you strain the ear will not hear. Ear will only feel when it feels comfortable and relaxed and you just let it listen.\nAs we do listen our color discrimination grows.\n\n3. level of perfect pitch: Refined color discrimination (you can tell if tone is sharp or flat to standard concert pitch)\n\nSome people think if you have perfect pitch that you have mental barometer in your brain witch just register [i]BOING[/i] and tells you exactly how high or low the pitch is.\n\nFirstly you can here this colors on your own instrument, but as soon as somebody plays it on some other instrument we have no idea, your completely lost. Now this is a common experience. This is perfect pitch but it's just one level of it. We can refine our hearing even more so that we can here it on all instruments. This would be called [b]Universal color discrimination[/b]. When the ear can here this colors clearly and recognized them in all the universal variety of pitches whether is our own instrument on piano, guitar, oboe, violin, bassoon, bells, little glasses of water, whistle or birds, voices.\nThe ear has to learn the distinction between pitch colors (pitch itself) and tone color (of the instrument). Spectral discrimination.\nIt's a human perception.\n\n4. level: aural recall (not raw memorising, it's hearing a color)\n\nWhen you want to sing Ab you don't judge how high or low the tone is. What you do you think up is the color sound. What does it sounds like.\n\n[b]Exercise[/b]\n[ul]Try F# ( 1 3 5 8 ) and Eb chords and listen to the difference. Were are not listening to a clear difference, it's a saddle thing. It's a feeling that when you play the F# chord and you move to the Eb something has changed.\nListen a little more for yourself.\nRead you perfect pitch handbook.\nAnother listen to the tones. Listen gently and easily to the tones.\n[/ul]"

Step by step.\nWhen you do know how to listen and progress step by step it becomes simplified.\nYou need to take the time to listen. You can't rush it.\nListen to each session all the way through including the parts that may on may not apply to you.\n\nYou go to the next masterclass after you have successfully finished all exercises.\n\nWhat instrument to use.\nThe result will be faster if you use the instrument you play most. \nThe instrument that your ear is most familiar with.\nYou can use that training on any instrument. But you have to get used to the sound first.\nYou can't do chords on a flute. But you can have flute chords on synthesiser.\nUse that one sound for all your ear training practice all the way up until we get to phase 3.\nRelative pitch is a different story.\n\nWe wanna do about two octave bellow middle C and two octave above.\nStart up using a medium range of tones on your instrument at first.\n\nSome of the exercises that were going to do are hearing exercises and some are singing exercises.\nWhen your doing a hearing exercises you just listen, you don't sing the tone. We don't wanna start judging pitches with our voice. We wanna learn the pitch by hearing.\n\nWere going to divide our exercises into three main categories:\n\n[ol]solo keyboards\nsolo guitar\nteams of two (additional drill methods)[/ol]\n\nEar training meditation technique.\nIt is important to clearly understand the theory behind perfect pitch and how perfect pitch becomes cultured into the ear.\nWe want to listen to each masterclasse one at the time. We never wanna do more then one masterclass in a day.\nTake as long as you need to practice the exercises. Maybe you'll need even three weeks on one particular homework assignment from a masterclass.\nWe don't rush ourself. We go at our own pace.\nWe don't wanna be left behind on any step. This is a crucial secret to perfect pitch development.\nWe don't practice for a long time each day. The short ear training session is all it takes. Actually your ear will go faster if you just give it a short session but you do it daily.\n\nFor our solo practises we just wanna listen for about 10 or 15 minutes. Don't think you have to go on, and on, and on. Sometimes when people train their ear to much then they find they can't hear anything. Has this ever happen to you? It's like you can take a shower for 10 minutes or 30 minutes. But 10 minutes is plane.\n\nThe same for teams.\nProgress to the next masterclass when you feel ready. And if by chance you ever get stuck anywhere in your practice....\n\n[b]Exercise - Phase 1 - Color hearing:[/b]\n\n[b]Solo keyboards[/b]\nReach to your keyboard and play any two white tones that are separated by one white tone like E and G. Were just using the white tones only. Now we listen carefully to sound of these two tones. Listen individually so that you can hear each of the two tones. Usually we may only hear the top tone. So we have to listen little more closely to the bottom tone. Let your ear get inside to hear the bottom tone as well as the top tone. Now to prove that you really are hearing these tones we sing them (from the bottom up). When you can sing the tones then you have proved that you really have heard both tones. You didn't just hear the top one. If you can't hear the bottom tone than play it. Listen to it separately. Then play the two tones together again and see if you can now hear the bottom tone. Just work with your ear like this. Take your time. Work with this drill until you can any two tones separate by one white tone. You don't have to name the pitch. Were just singing the tones.\n\n[b]Solo guitar[/b]\nJust play a string at random and just try to tell which it is. Learn your string.\n\n[b]Solo instrumentalist[/b]\nEvan easter. Just listen carefully to C and D (regardless of your instrument, if your Bb instrument your C will sound Bb) and sing them very concisely like a meditation. Here is how we do it. Listen to C on your instrument. Gently hear the tone. Let it sock into your ear. Then here the pitch in your own mind. Imagine the pitch then sing the pitch (Laaa) and then sing the pitch again. Were just using C and D right now. We don't have to worry about any other tones. And were using it on our own instrument.\n\nHave fun!\n"

Right now were getting our ear to zoom in on our tones to unlock them. So that were able to hear each tone discretly. Now were gana make it a little trickier. Were ganna do the same things with major and minor seconds.\n\n[i]Solo keyboards[/i]\n[ol]1. Major and minor seconds (harmonicly, only white tones). And were singing it from the bottom up (melodicly).\nA little bit of an ear teaser for you to sort out the top tone from the bottom tone. As you continue they clearify. When you can sing it then your ear has open up that much more.\n2. Unlock any two tones using one hand only (octave) and sing them from the bottom up.\n3. Unlock wide tones. This means we play our tones wide. We reach out with two hands and play tones that are more spaced out ( bigger then one octave ) and we sing them from the bottom up. The octave is not important. Were listening them in whatever the octave they are and were singing them in what ever range voice we can sing them\n[/ol]\n\n[i]Last unlocking solo drills.[/i]\n[ol]4. Do three tones close. Reach out play any three tones one handed. We listen , we unlock the sounds with our ears so we here each note discretly and then we sing them from the bottom up. And we check ourselfs.\n5. Three tones wide. Reach out, play two tones in one hand and one tone in the other hand.\n[/ol]\n\nRemember, go slow on this drills. We listen with great intrest. Remember, its the listening that is opening our ear. So evan if we can do this drill easily we still need to take time to listen. This is the key to development of perfect pitch. If you for example can't hear the middle tone in drill 4. Listen again, and play separatly. And then play the problem chord again. Allow you ear to relax. Don't strain or force you ear in any way. Any time you find that a chord is trickie it just go to proof that you ear was not hearing thise things all along. The ear was sleeping. It just shows we need ear traning. Keep working on our ear and youl find that it will cooperate and it will begin to hear this things. The magic formula is: keep listening, keep listening, keep listening and listen gently.\n\n[b]Meditation tehnique for this session[/b]\n[i]All instrumentalist[/i]\nWe play a tone, we think of it, and we sing it again.\nWe think the tone before we sing it. This is the diference.\nWe always correct our mistakes. We never just move on. We always take the time to hear the wrong note and the right note.\nDo it like a meditation. Slow, queit, easy and relaxed.\n\n[i]Solo guitar[/i]\nThe same as solo keyboards.\n\nWe'll considure to have pass that drill when we can do one verification round.\nA verification round means that you pass tweny examples in a row all corectly without a mistake.\nIf you didn't do it right you have to correct your error.

We're using the C major scale so you would know the tones by relative pitch. At this point we don't have full color discrimination. So the ear needs something to latch on to in order to know the tone. And thats fine if you know the tone by relative pitch. Just name the pitch. Don't be to hasty with your pitch naming. Go slowly. Listen to the tone. Take an interest in the tone. Allow a tone to soak for a moment. Something else is happening inside. If you get it wrong then pause. Listen to both tones. And you can even listen to it in a relationship to the C. One verification round.[/ul]\n\n[i]Solo guitars[/i]\nTwo stings at a time and unlock them by ear. From the bottom up.
